                Hello World!
              </h1>
              Growing up, one of my favorite past times was shopping and
              dressing up with my mom. We would spend our weekends pillaging the
              sale section of department stores, looking for deals on pieces
              that we felt beautiful in.
              <br />
              {readMore && (
                <>
                  <br />
                  Somewhere in between those blissful, weekend shopping trips as
                  a kid, and the tumultous years of adolscence when my self
                  awareness heightened and my self confidence dropped, I stopped
                  enjoying shopping, and I struggled to feel good in anything
                  that I wore.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This continued for most of my early twenties. I remember
                  visiting home during the holidays, and turning down my
                  mom&apos;s invitations to go shopping, which I knew were also
                  invitations to bond and reconnect.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It wasn&apos;t until my mid twenties, when I started to
                  understand and accept who I was, that I rediscovered my love
                  for shopping and putting together outfits. Around that time, I
                  also learned about personal style, and I found that defining
                  my personal style helped make shopping less overwhelming, and
                  made getting ready everyday easier and fun again. <br />{" "}
                  <br />
                  So as a software engineer, I wanted to try creating a platform
                  that helps other people in their journey to find their
                  personal style too. Everyone deserves to feel good in what
                  they wear, and who they are. I hope that RateYourStyle can
                  help you achieve that.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  With love, <br />
